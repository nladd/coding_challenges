# Prime number identifier
Write a function, `isPrime()`, that has a single input and returns a true if the input is a prime number and otherwise false. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is evenly divisible only by 1 and itself.

E.g. `isPrime(13)` returns true, `isPrime(15)` returns false.
